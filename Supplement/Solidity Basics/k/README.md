## Compiling the exercises and running the tests

```make [exercise-folder]/[exercise-file].kompile``` 

and then run the tests by executing:

```make tests/[exercise-folder]/[test-file].krun```.

For example, the first exercise can be compiled with 

```
make 01-calc/calc.k.kompile
```

and the first associated test can be run with 

```
make tests/01-calc/1.calc.krun
```
